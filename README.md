Having two days at hand to complete the task, first of all, I read documentation of different React JS features which I have to use in this project. After some reading and researching, I visited Ant Design website and had a gist of the provided layout and other library features.

On the first day, after all that research and keeping all the requirements in mind, I started to code in Visual Studio Code. First of all, I imported a layout from Ant Design and customized it according to my needs. Then I created an Input Box and a compare button as required. I also added a footer and stylize the webpage.

On the second day, I went on to the part which I found most challenging, ie, to fetch data from API using react hooks. I learned about different states and how hooks let us to use states with functional components and tried to implement them.
